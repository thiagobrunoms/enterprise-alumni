# Welcome to EnterpriseAlumni Flutter Assessment

## Introduction
Consider this assignment as a regular development task that you would receive  if you were part of our team. You are free to read documentation, access stackoverflow, and use Google basically. But please refrain from using ChatGPT and similar AI solutions to generate an implementation. We need to evaluate "your" ability to understand the task and provide solution for it.

## Description

For state management we are using flutter_hooks, you can see more info here https://github.com/rrousselGit/flutter_hooks. 
We have custom hooks to help us with async operations, please take a look at /lib/utils/ut_custom_hooks.dart to understand how to use it.
